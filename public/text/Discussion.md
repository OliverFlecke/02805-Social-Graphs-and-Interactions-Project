It was clear that there is no real correlation betweeen how busy an airport is and how much people enjoy those airports. It was seen that airports in the Middle East are quite popular. Could this perhaps be due to the fact that these airports are newer and lots of money have been spent on making them luxurious? The recent rise of wealth of Middle East countries could be considered and also the age of the older airports in e.g. Europe or North America could be a factor. These are all factors that can be considered when finding the best airports.

Furthermore one could consider using something else than twitter to analyze what people think of airports, or at least optimize the use of twitter for this. For this project the 100 most recent tweets at a specific airport was used. 100 tweets is a small sample size. Furthermore the tweets were collected over the duration of a couple of hours, so there is a lot of variance in the time of day of the tweets. The different timezones weren't considered either. These are some of the few things that could be improved upon.
