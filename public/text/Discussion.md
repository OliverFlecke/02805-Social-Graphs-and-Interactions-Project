From the analyse of Twitter, no real correlation between how busy an airport is and how much people like or dislike those airports was found.
Instead, it was noted that airports in different regions of the world, such as the Middle East, are quite popular.
This could be due to the fact that these airports are newer and more money have been spent on making them modern and luxurious, compared to the older and worn airports of North America and Europe.
These are all factors that can be considered when finding the best airports.

Furthermore, a better data source than Twitter should be consided to analyze what people think of airports, as only small subset of travelers is tweeting from airports.
For this project, only the 100 most recent tweets at a specific airport was used, which usually all was tweeted within a very short timespan.
All this means that we only get a narrow and biased insight into people's oppion of the airports.
