The wordcloud for the negative tweets shows some quite different words than we say before.
We see that people are tweeting the word _die_ (and _death_), likely because many people are afraid of flying.
_Custody_ and _arrested_ also appear as often used words, which mean people must like to tweet about being stopped by security in the airport, which as expected does not leave the travelers in a positive mood.
A few cities can also be found, such as _Lagos_ and _Berlin_, which might tell you that you should avoid these cities.
There are also several other words which one would connect to a bad experience at the airport, including _cancelled_, _delay_, and _queues_.
