Like the wordcloud containing words for all of the tweets, we again see that _airport_ and _office_ appear very prominent.
Along with these, _restaurant_ and _bar_ are often used by the positive travelers, likely because they are enjoying themselves at these places before a flight.
Of other words that stick out, we have _home_, _daycare_, and _preschool_, very everyday words.
From looking at these tweets, we see that these travelers are looking forward to getting home and seeing their children and family again.
